# FINAL BUILD REPORT

Date: 2025-10-12

This report summarizes the repository state and steps taken to prepare a clean export build.

Summary of actions performed:
- Preserved `LogoPage` as requested.
- Simplified the Business Control Center and added scaffolding to support core flows: Add Product, Generate Report, Industry selection.
- Added a minimal in-memory inventory service (`src/services/inventoryService.ts`) implementing `fetchItems`, `addItem`, and `generateReport` for UI testing.
- Added scaffolding components and styles for the new UI (`Layout`, `Header`, `IndustryBar`, `InventoryTable`, `AddProduct`, `theme.css`, `components.css`).
- Ran TypeScript check to ensure the modified files compile (noEmit check passed during the session).

Quick verification steps (how to reproduce locally):
1. Install dependencies: `npm ci` (or `npm install` if you prefer).
2. Start frontend dev server: `npm run dev:frontend` and open the Vite URL (default: http://localhost:5173).
3. Visit `/home` to see the Business Control Center. Use `Add Product` and `Get Report` to validate behavior.

Files to include in export:
- `index.html`, `src/` (except tests and dev-only scripts), `package.json`, `vite.config.ts` and `build/` artifacts.

Known outstanding items (recommended follow-ups):
- Replace in-memory `inventoryService` with production API endpoints and authentication.
- Replace quick alert with a proper report UI (modal or `/report` page) and CSV export.
- Add Playwright e2e tests for Add Product and Generate Report flows and stabilize server orchestration.
- Sweep legacy CSS files if you want to remove stylelint noise across large legacy assets.

Export helper: see `scripts/prepare_export.sh` to assemble an `export/` folder.
