- **Created cleanup script** at `/scripts/diagnostic-files-cleanup.js`
- **Proper directory structure** for scripts, tests, docs, and dev files
- **Production-ready root** with only essential files
- **Centralized component management** with proper separation of concerns

### ⚡ **Performance Improvements**
- **Optimized lazy loading** with better error boundaries
- **Reduced bundle size** through component extraction
- **Enhanced PWA setup** with proper error handling
- **Platform optimizations** separated into reusable hooks
- **Better memory management** with proper cleanup functions

### 📦 **Component Structure Enhancement**
```
