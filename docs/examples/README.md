# Examples and Demos

This folder contains historical demo pages and example HTML files that were previously hosted under `src/public/`.

They have been moved out of the deployed public folder to avoid exposing prototype/demo pages in production. Keep them here for reference or to recreate marketing/demo surfaces.

Files included in the original project that were moved or removed:
- demo.html
- main-page-demo.html
- investor-demo.html
- emergency-reset.html
- FINAL_BUILD_SUCCESS_REPORT.html
- test-camera-route.html
- test-analytics-integration.html
- other test- and demo- HTML pages

If you need any of these restored to a staging site, we can copy selected files back into `src/public/` and protect them behind a route that requires a secret token or non-production environment flag.
